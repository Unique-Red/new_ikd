    THE HERITAGE OF IKORODU<br>Ikorodu Town is the second most populous Local Government Area in Lagos state with a population estimated at about 2 million people. Ikorodu is peopled by Ijebu speaking sub-group of Yoruba who occupy modern Ikorodu local government area of Lagos State.      Ikorodu: 'Ilu kekere oko ilu bantata' meaning: A small town that is a boss of big towns. Originally, the name "Ikorodu" was derived from the two words OKO-ODU Meaning the farm (OKO) of (ODU) a kind of plant. The word ODU means something that blackens, and since it was discovered that the plant had blacking power and it was in effect used in dyeing cloth- the name ODU was applied to it. It's significant to note that the trade of Ikorodu early women was cloth dyeing, which followed from the discovery of the dyeing power of ODU plant.<br>The people are very hardworking and sociable.<br>Ikorodu was initially a massive forest that lies on a few kilometers North of the Lagos Lagoon and less than 10 kilometers North of the Atlantic Ocean was once a walled City. By itself, Ikorodu was bounded in the East by both sides of Ota-Ona, Awolowo Road, including Ojoru and Agbele up to Itamaja. On the west side are Aiyeluja, both sides of Ayangbure road up till Oke-Oriya extending to Solomade, Etunrenren, Lowa and Olori and both sides of Lagos Road up to Owutu junction. Extension to the North covers both sides of Sagamu Road up to Sawmill and beyond to Odogunyan. Southwards covers Gbasemo in Aga linking up with Ipakorodo-Igbogbo road up to Owode, Oriwu road and Solafun (in Ijomu ward). The area was first used by the sons of (King) Akarigbo Koyelu of Orile Offin, Orisa Gaomu (Sagamu). One of the son of Oduduwa from Ile Ife Olusoga (Oga), Lasunwon, Rademo, Anoko, Osonusi, Oladepo and Sekumade. These were the children of Akarigbo who used the extended area for hunting and farming. Because vegetation of the area was predominanlty ODU plant, hence they referred to the area as the farm of ODU meaning OKO-ODU which was by Remo accent called OKORODU. By long careless usage, it is now called IKORODU.</p>
